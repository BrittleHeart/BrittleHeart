- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BrittleHeart it is nice to meet you. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cooking, watching film, mountain climbing and creating awesome stuff for instance, recently I have fallen in love with #Flutter. 
The scale of potencial possibilites as Flutter provides to us is awesome, it makes me fall in love once again in IT. I don't know why but it is as it is
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning something new, as I mentioned before. Creating, testing - expecialy testing new apps. I am reading about Docker and Kubernetes's Cluster,
about possibilites of Jest, Vue.. But currently I am exited about flutter and raspberry Pi. I wonder what can I do with these cool tools.
